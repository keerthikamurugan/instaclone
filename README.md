InstaClone is an Android app project that I developed as a part of my journey in the field of mobile app development. Inspired by the popular social media platform Instagram, InstaClone replicates some of the key features and functionalities that make Instagram engaging and user-friendly. Leveraging my skills in app development and my proficiency in Java and Android Studio, I created a platform where users can share images, connect with friends, and explore a visually rich feed.
